LOCATION:

Within walking distance of Trad Room, Winona’s, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and Prospect Park, HOME0001’s Bed-Stuy location is also close to the A, C, G, J, M, and Z trains into Manhattan.

Originally settled by the Dutch in the 17th century, Bed-Stuy’s name combines the hamlets of Bedford (named after a market village in England) and Stuyvesant Heights (named after Peter Stuyvesant, the last Governor of the Colony of New Netherland). Bed-Stuy evolved into a more densely residential neighborhood through the 19th and early 20th centuries and, in the mid-20th century, became a cultural and political home for New York’s African American communities and a hub for civil rights activism. Bed-Stuy has been a major hotbed for music since the 1910s, with early jazz pioneers and modern hip-hop artists hailing from the neighborhood.
