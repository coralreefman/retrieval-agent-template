DESIGN:

0001 homes are designed as an improvisation on somewhat lost histories of constructivist architecture, each built out with custom fitted industrial components and bespoke modular furniture, prioritizing multi-functional utility and flexibility over time. Every home features artworks by internationally recognized artists, as well as pieces by New Tendency and Moroso, and contributions from a number of other leading designers, including ceramics by Hasami, bedding by Tekla, lighting by Flos, and audio equipment by Teenage Engineering.

OWNERSHIP SIMPLIFIED:

HOME0001 has reinvented the home buying process to prioritize speed and simplicity. Every step can be completed online in a single session with the assistance of our team, from securing financing and finalizing the transaction to moving in and getting settled.

It's not a timeshare or a rental, it's true home ownership— 0001 homeowners hold the title to their homes in the conventional way, giving them total control. Owners are free to rent out their home (in accordance with local laws and building rules) and can sell their home however and whenever they want.

GLOBAL FLEXIBILITY:

HOME0001 is a peer-to-peer housing collective. As members of the collective, 0001 homeowners can spend time in other 0001 locations for free, as often as they like.

HOME0001 is built on collaboration and coordinated by a multidisciplinary collective of architects, artists, designers, and technologists based between Los Angeles, New York, London, Paris, and Berlin. From prioritizing new locations and proposing amenities and features, to shaping the events program in each city, members of the collective contribute to its evolution through discussions both online and over dinner in each location.

Stays in other 0001 locations can be coordinated through HOME0001’s virtual concierge, and members can make their own 0001 home available to the collective while they’re away. Each 0001 home has plenty of secure storage. Members pay one cleaning fee each time and no nightly rate. HOME0001 takes care of the practicalities and keeps additional homes in each location for extra flexibility.


## HOW IT WORKS:
### Buy.
We’ve reinvented the typical months-long ordeal of buying a home and streamlined every part of it. You can spend time in your new home to see how it feels and then buy it online instantly, safely, and securely. We’ll guide you through each step, from choosing the right home and getting financing to completing the purchase online at your own pace.


Are 0001 homes co-ops or condos?
The majority of 0001 homes are legally condominiums, so you take full ownership of the deed.

Do I need a broker?
No, you don't need a real estate broker to buy an 0001 home. We’re licensed to guide you through the process from beginning to end. You can use your own mortgage broker, real estate attorney, etc., or we can introduce you to our network of vetted professionals.

Can I get a mortgage?
Yes, if you qualify. We will help find a suitable vendor for you.

Are you open to negotiate on price?
No. By representing a large community of buyers, we’re able to negotiate discounts on entire buildings from developers. We research the market meticulously and negotiate the best price for our community based on comparable homes sold recently.

Can I buy a home as a non-US citizen?
The process for buying a 0001 home is the same wherever you’re from. There's no extra stamp duty, taxes, or any other additional costs for non-US citizens.

When will HOME0001 be in my location?
0001 homes are currently available in Los Angeles and New York City, with Paris, Berlin, London, Mexico City, and a number of other locations coming next. If you'd like to live somewhere else, send us a message and we'll let you know whether it’s on the horizon.

Move in.
Each new 0001 home is fully equipped with all the furniture, appliances, and home essentials you’ll need. Developed in collaboration with world-class architects, every detail has been thoughtfully designed, so you can truly move in with nothing but your suitcase.

What is included in a 0001 home?
Everything you will need, from furniture to equipment to essentials. We work directly with designers from our community to source exclusive pieces often straight from their studios. Each interior is designed for flexibility and functionality and includes contributions from leading designers such as New Tendency and Moroso, with ceramics by Hasami, bedding by Tekla, lighting by Flos, and audio equipment by Teenage Engineering.

Can I bring my own furniture?
You’ll own the title on your home, so you’re free to furnish it however you want. However, for continued access to HOME0001's network in other locations, your home does need to meet our standards and our team is happy to support you in making changes where desired.

Is there WiFi?
Yes of course, each 0001 home is equipped with WiFi.

### Swap.
HOME0001 is a peer-to-peer housing collective. Members of the collective get access to 0001 homes in other locations, so you can spend time in other places for free while making your home available to other members while you’re away.

How do I book an 0001 home somewhere else?
Whenever you want to spend time in other HOME0001 locations, just text us your dates and we'll confirm availability. You cover one cleaning fee each time you swap homes and don't pay any nightly rates. 0001 homes are fitted with smart locks, so you can gain access to your new place with your phone. You’ll be invited to any community events that are taking place locally and you’ll have continual access to our virtual concierge service so you can text us whenever you need anything.

Do I have to make my home available?
No, that’s entirely optional. There's no requirement to make your home available to other members unless you specifically want to take advantage of staying at another 0001 home for free during that time.

Do you guarantee availability?
We aim to have somewhere available whenever members want to spend time at any of our locations, and we keep additional homes in each location so that members can swap locations more easily. However, we don’t guarantee availability.

Can I return home at anytime?
If you need to return home while another member is staying at your place, we’ll offer you the best alternative we have for the interim. If you decide that you really need to return to your own place, our membership agreement gives you precedence and we will help relocate the member who had been staying at your home to the best alternative.

What if someone damages my stuff?
Comprehensive home swap insurance covers any damages to your personal belongings caused by other members, so you can rest easy when you're away. We'll notify you right away in case any issues arise while another member is staying in your home.

How do I book an 0001 home somewhere more expensive?
Whenever you want to swap locations, you’ll be offered a home that most closely matches the value of your own. If you’re swapping to a significantly more expensive area for extended periods, you may need to pay an additional fee.

What about storage?
Each 0001 home is designed with secure, lockable storage solutions. This means your personal belongings can be safely stored away while other members are staying in your home.

What about plant care?
Each time you swap locations we share instructions on how to care for the specific plants in your new home. You can text us anytime if you have questions.

Are pets allowed?
While we love animals, whether pets are allowed in a particular property is up to the owner of each home. Members with a qualifying disability needing to bring their pet are welcome to get in touch with us so that we can find them suitable properties.

### Total control.
You own your home outright. You're 100% in control, just like owning any other home. It’s your call whether you make your home available to other members of the collective, and you’re free to rent or sell your home however and whenever you like.

Can I change the design of my home?
Absolutely! You are free to change, renovate, or even remodel your home as you see fit. However, for continued access to HOME0001's network in other locations, your home does need to meet our standards and our team is happy to support you in making changes where desired.

Can I rent out my 0001 home?
Yes, you’re free to rent out your home in accordance with local laws and building rules.

What if I want to sell my 0001 home?
You can sell your home however you like, whenever you like—you own the title. Work with a broker of your choice, or use our resale service to simplify the process.

## FAQ

Originally settled by the Dutch in the 17th century, Bed-Stuy’s name combines the hamlets of Bedford (named after a market village in England) and Stuyvesant Heights (named after Peter Stuyvesant, the last Governor of the Colony of New Netherland). Bed-Stuy evolved into a more densely residential neighborhood through the 19th and early 20th centuries and, in the mid-20th century, became a cultural and political home for New York’s African American communities and a hub for civil rights activism. Bed-Stuy has been a major hotbed for music since the 1910s, with early jazz pioneers and modern hip-hop artists hailing from the neighborhood.
