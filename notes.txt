agent
a system powered by LLM that decides what actions to take

agent runtime
runs agent in a loop

langchain not cyclical 

langgraph creates cyclical runtime

there are agent executors and chatbot executors 

langsmith for tracing / logging
`os.environ("LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2") = "true`

each node can pass/push updates to state, instead of passing the state around from node to node

two types of edges
conditional: based on result take different path
normal: always execute
